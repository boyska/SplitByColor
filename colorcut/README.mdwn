This component is dedicated to finding cirlces using Python + OpenCV.
Just ensure that you have opencv installed (pacman -S opencv, if you use
archlinux) and run:

    python2 cdect.py

Color tuning
==============

Color is expressed in HSV. The scale is [255,255,255]. This means that a
typical green is 60, blue is 120.
Ideally, the hue is the only parameter you need to tune. But depending on
shooting conditions, you may also need to tune saturation and value.


Circle detection
===================

Most "circle detection" options are pretty intuitive. Some are definitely not,
especially param2


Radius size
------------


you can specify a range of accepted radii (in px) for the circles.
If you know the resolution of the image, the size of the photographed object in
cm, and the size of the circles in cm, you can easily calculate the exact
radius as

    (pixelwidth / objectwidth) * circlewidth

use min-radius and max-radius as some neighbourhood of this point, and it should work.


Circle distance
-----------------

You can specify a minimum distance between circles. This will avoid that
circles too near will all be detected. Similarly to the radius size, you can
tune this if you know the distance between the real circles.


param2
--------

This is HoughCircles param2. Just remember that the higest, the more selective.
The lower, the more false positives.
